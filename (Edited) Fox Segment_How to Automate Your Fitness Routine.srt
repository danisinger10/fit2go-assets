1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,063
- [Narrator] This is Fox 45 Morning News.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,220
- Well up next we have
a workout plan that's so

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,670
automatic it works like
a computer program.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,950
We have expert advice
on getting your routine

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,080
down to a T.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,160
Well here to stress the
benefits of an automated

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,930
workout routine, we have CEO
of Fit To Go Personal Training,

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,940
Dani Singer, so good morning to you,

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,880
you've got quite the set
up here in our studio.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,360
- We're gonna have fun today, so--

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,220
- What is an automated workout routine?

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,840
- The idea is that you
want to make your morning

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,788
fitness routine, or whatever
your fitness routine is,

14
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:31,780
you want to make it automatic, right?

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,330
That's something we've talked about a lot.

16
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,760
But, the idea is that when
you're first initiating

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,456
your fitness plan, your
routine, you have to

18
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,780
take some willpower.

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,140
Take some conscious effort.

20
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,600
But eventually you want
to get to the point

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,045
that there's no willpower--

22
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:44,878
- Not even thinking about it.

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,711
- Exactly, there's no decisions

24
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:46,810
even being made in the moment.

25
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,990
So what we're gonna do today,
is I'm gonna walk through

26
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,610
what a sample morning fitness
routine might be like.

27
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,530
Or just a routine in
general with fitness kind of

28
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,170
automatically in there, without
any thoughts in the moment.

29
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,160
- Okay.
- Ready to do this?

30
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,687
- I'm gonna let you take over.

31
00:00:58,687 --> 00:01:01,420
- All right, so, you start
off, you're down on the ground,

32
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,260
you're sleeping right?

33
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,810
The alarm goes off, you're dreading it,

34
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,780
but now you're not dreading
it because you know

35
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,790
you have a routine set up.

36
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,660
So you get up, you go, you go right away,

37
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,110
first thing you do, as
soon as you get up, you

38
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,010
brush your teeth, done.

39
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,480
Okay, that's automatic,
most people are brushing

40
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,360
their teeth first thing
in the morning anyways.

41
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,460
But then you've anchored
it, so as soon you finish

42
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,571
brushing your teeth,
your brain knows next up,

43
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:22,340
I get in my workout clothes.

44
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,900
And my workout clothes
are already laid out

45
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,797
from the night before, so
you throw that on right away.

46
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:29,061
- I like that, I've heard of
some people sleeping in them.

47
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:29,894
I could never do that.

48
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:32,243
- I wanted to breakaway pants
that I could just rip off.

49
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,630
Then, bam, you go right to your workout.

50
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,730
And your workouts already
preplanned, you already

51
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,740
know exactly what you're doing.

52
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,690
So you're going into your
workout, maybe 10, 20 minutes,

53
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,900
whatever it is, you get that done.

54
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,830
Automatic, next, bam,
you go into the shower,

55
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,890
you clean up, you smell
great, you throw on some

56
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,580
cologne, now this we gave
its own station right here

57
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,203
with the protein shake,
because this is so key.

58
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:53,090
- Okay, this is important.

59
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,050
- Something like this, what's
it take, like 30 seconds

60
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,670
to a minute to blend your protein shake?

61
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,180
Blend it the night before,
because that little bit

62
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,690
of time may be the
difference between whether or

63
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,545
not you have time to actually make it.

64
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:04,680
But if it's ready in your
fridge, you can grab and go.

65
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,347
- Okay, what do you like to do for yours?

66
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:07,950
- For the protein shake?
- Yeah.

67
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,010
- Just a scoop of whey, I put
a little casein in mine too.

68
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,967
But really any protein shake
that's just high in protein

69
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,790
lower in sugar, will be
a good protein shake.

70
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,623
- Okay, and you've got it on the go,

71
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:17,820
so you can also keep moving.

72
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,830
- Exactly, and then, once
you've finished that up.

73
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,890
You've already hit your fitness
routine for the day right?

74
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,630
That's already done, so now
it's just time to get ready

75
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,540
and look awesome because
you've already got your workout

76
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,830
in, you smell great, and
you're ready to go and head off

77
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,670
to work.

78
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,290
So then you've got all dressed--

79
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,123
- Doing out little dance here.

80
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,263
- Looking good, and bam,
you're starting your work day.

81
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,203
You got your coffee.

82
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,280
- You don't have to worry
about fitting it in.

83
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,113
- You're ready to go.

84
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:48,960
- So what is a good length of time,

85
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,810
I'm sure this is gonna take
awhile to become a habit

86
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,050
to fit this all in.

87
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,080
How long are you saying
workouts should be here?

88
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,000
- So, the workout that we
give a lot of our clients

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,470
is called "The P.A.U.L.
Method", which literally takes

90
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,890
10 minutes, it's just a body workout.

91
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,470
You can get that on our website for free.

92
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,820
But the idea is that, figure
out what works for you.

93
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,330
However much time you have,
even if its 10 minutes,

94
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,960
you're gonna see a lot
of benefit from there.

95
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,440
But more important than anything
else is make it automatic,

96
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,320
make it a routine, remember
what we went through, right?

97
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,990
My cue was the second I
finish brushing my teeth,

98
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,930
I put on my workout clothes.

99
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,359
Second I finish putting
on my workout clothes,

100
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,192
I start my workout.

101
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,540
So it's automatic,
there's no decision moment

102
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,720
do I workout or not.

103
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,800
It just happens.

104
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,460
- Are you doing this five days a week,

105
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,069
or when's your off day?

106
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,160
- So it depends, if you
do a 10 minute workout

107
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,537
you might want to do it every single day.

108
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:31,970
If you're doing something
a little more intense,

109
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,080
they might want to take some off days.

110
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,530
But whatever it is, it should
be consistent and automatic.

111
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,870
- [Shelly] And you're not
even saying people have to go

112
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,310
to the gym, and do all of this.

113
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,500
You can work out in your
home, like that's what we

114
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,640
even said, put on a quick home workout.

115
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,850
- [Dani] Exactly, yeah, I
mean yeah that's what we're

116
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,680
all about, we're fitness
for busy professionals

117
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,510
at Fit2Go, so we do in-home training.

118
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,380
We train our clients at
home but more importantly

119
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,530
we teach them to work
out on their own in home

120
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,610
in between sessions.

121
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,310
Because we want them to
build those habits that'll

122
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,380
last long term.

123
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,350
- [Shelly] Okay, and people want to

124
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,610
get in touch do you learn more.

125
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,980
- Fit2GoPT.com, I'm Dani Singer, Fit2Go

126
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,157
and we'll talk to you then.

127
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,893
- All right, thank you very much Dani.
