Featured Expert: Dani Singer, CPT - CEO of Fit2Go Personal Training
Key Quotes from Dani Singer:
"You're probably doing it wrong, and if you want to get results, it's key to get the form right."
"It's not something you should expect to do right from the get-go."
"You'll feel that the next day," says Singer. "You'll feel a bit sore and feel your arms getting more firm-that's the result right there."
"When you get into full push-ups, you should see your arms getting more firm."
"If your goal is to look better and tone up, then nutrition is the most important piece."
Summary & Context:
Topic: How to build push-up strength safely and effectively
Core Message: Most beginners perform push-ups with poor form. Dani emphasizes that proper technique is more important than quantity.
Key Points:
Proper form involves a straight back and controlled motion
Beginners should not start with knee push-ups; instead, use incline push-ups for better core engagement
A structured progression plan is outlined:
Start with 3 sets of 5 incline push-ups
Increase reps weekly until hitting 3 sets of 10
Lower the incline and repeat progression
Final goal: 10 full floor push-ups
Push-ups alone won't reshape your body if you're carrying excess weight - nutrition must be addressed

Publication Date: December 1, 2016
Featured Expert: Dani Singer, C.P.T., Fitness Director at Fit2Go Personal Training
Context: The article discusses whether traditional cardio is necessary for a lean physique, using influencer Sophie Guidolin as a case study. Dani is quoted to clarify how high-intensity interval training (HIIT) compares to traditional cardio.
Quote:
"HIIT will help burn fat and save time, but it doesn't necessarily fall under the category of 'cardio' since it's not steady-state, relentless activity," Singer says. "Traditional cardio does provide some health benefits-particularly for your heart-that you wouldn't get from strength training alone."
Topic: Differentiating HIIT vs. steady-state cardio
Takeaway: While HIIT offers efficiency and fat loss benefits, traditional cardio still holds unique cardiovascular value. Dani reinforces the need for balance and purpose-driven programming.
